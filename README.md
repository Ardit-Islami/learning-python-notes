# Learning Python: Jupyter Notebook Series

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks documenting my hands-on journey through Python programming concepts, from foundational principles to advanced techniques. Each notebook focuses on a specific topic, combining theory with practical examples and code implementations.

## ðŸ“˜ Notebooks Included

- **1. Object Oriented** â€” Introduction to object-oriented programming concepts like classes, objects, and methods.
- **2. Dynamic Programming** â€” Solving problems by breaking them down into subproblems, with a focus on efficiency.
- **3. Functional Programming** â€” Exploring pure functions, higher-order functions, and functional style.
- **4. List Comprehension** â€” Using list comprehensions for concise, readable data transformations.
- **5. Closures** â€” Understanding closures and function environments.
- **6. Decorators** â€” Applying decorators to modify function behavior.
- **7. First Class Functions** â€” Treating functions as first-class citizens in Python.
- **8. Recursion** â€” Breaking down problems into smaller subproblems via recursive calls.
- **9. Abstract Data Structures (Stack)** â€” Implementing stack data structures.
- **9.5. Abstract Data Structures (Queue)** â€” Implementing queue data structures.
- **10. Memoization** â€” Caching results to optimize recursive solutions.
- **11. RegEx** â€” Using regular expressions for pattern matching and text processing.
- **12. NumPy** â€” Leveraging NumPy for numerical computations and broadcasting.
- **13. Exception Handling** â€” Managing errors and exceptions in Python programs.
- **14. Multithreading** â€” Basics of multithreading for concurrent execution.
- **15. Itertools** â€” Efficient iterator building with the itertools module.
- **16. Abstract Data Structures (Stack revisit)** â€” Further examples with stack operations.
